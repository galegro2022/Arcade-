# Project-2-quarter-arcade

## Description

Welcome to Quarter Arcade! This is a full-stack application that lets you search for games and save them for later so you can purchase them from a retailer. We wanted to make a website that makes it easier to learn about games from different genres that a user may be interested in since there are thousands of games and it can be difficult to find something to play. Some things we learned how to do were deploy an application to heroku, retrieve data through GET and POST routes, and use MYSQL for the database.
